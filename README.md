# This is my first time here editing a readme file so just ignore All that is down there... because All of it are about React.... so if u want to know more about react, Then [Click Here](https://reactjs.org)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

So this is the start of this react thingy..... But I personally wanted to ans a fewques here...... that's all haha... so react is a library of Js (JavaScript)... many say..Hey tell me is [React](https://reactjs.org) a library or a framework of js??....

To ans that, we should know what library and framework is and by knowing that, we will understand what react is..... SIMPLE ANSWER.. A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn't. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it...EZ...

 And if u have read the documentation... it's pretty normal for u to understand by now that React is a library and not a frameWork....

 # I have to Sleep...

 So I will continue next day or maybe never...

 ( it was a just a typing practice from a keyboard and screen :) ]

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
